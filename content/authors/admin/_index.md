      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Dr. Tarun Naskar is an assistant professor in the Geotechnical Engineering Division of the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Madras and the Principal Investigator for Wave Propagation lab IITM. He earned his B.E in Civil Engineering from Bengal Engineering & Science University (now Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology), Shibpur in 2008. He obtained his M.E (Topper of Geotech division) and Ph.D. (Geotechnical) in Civil Engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India in 2018. Dr. Tarunâ€™s research interests are wave propagation in an elastic medium, SASW/MASW, bender element test, ground response analysis, geotechnical earthquake engineering, and artificial intelligence. His research is majorly focused on developing an efficient inversion tool for practicing engineers to obtain a fast and reliable shear wave velocity profile by incorporating deep learning in the area of geophysical data analysis. He co-authored several articles in peer-reviewed journals such as Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Canadian Geotechnical Journal, Journal of Geophysics & Engineering, and Geophysics. He teaches undergraduate and postgraduate level courses such as advanced soil mechanics and computer methods in civil engineering at IITM. He is involved in various projects across India, focusing on the determination of accurate shear wave velocity profile of irregularly dispersive subsurface using MASW. Apart from academics, Dr. Tarun actively participates in trekking, writing poems and reading books. He trekked to the mighty Himalayas, and his most recent one was Kalindi Pass (~6000m)
